        </div>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>2 eggs + water</li>
                <li>Powdered sugar</li>
                <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
                <li>Vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>
                <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into an 8x8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick - that's ok.</li>
                <li>Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
                <p>Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They also freeze well for up to a month. Last time I made these, I doubled the recipe and stored the second batch in the freezer. It was so fun to have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon treat!</p>
